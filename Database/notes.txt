If we ignore the namespace conventions, we can make the Autoloader not work, and that way make it more
attractive to load via the MANDATORY factory :-)

We can also make constructor private, and let the "create" method load via the Factory. This forces all loads to be
done via the factory and enforces code completion...

SOLUTION:
Make an abstract class with the method-signatures (empty) in base class, a private constructor and
a factory method that loads the relevant implementation.

Implementations inherits from base class, so they can only be created through the factory method,
and must implement all the relevant methods
