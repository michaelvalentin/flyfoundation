#FlyFoundation

<i>FlyFoundation is a platform for developing simple, data-intensive web-applications fast.</i>

It is currently under development, but is going to include a DSL for defining system aspects
such as data model, validations and routing centrally and with a minimum of hazzle. In the
long run the platform will provide dynamic generation of advanaced features common in 
data-intensive web-applications, such as translations, versioning, ACL, etc.

##Got any ideas?
Please get in touch with me if you are interested in the project or have any good ideas for
the further development. I'm available at mv@signifly.com or Skype: michael_valentin.

Happy hacking! :-)
