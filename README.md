**Bachelor project hand-in Commit**

**CURRENT STATUS: Not suitable for production**

*The FlyFoundation framework is under development, but not yet stable for
production environments. Feel free to check it out, play around with it,
and consider giving a hand in taking the FlyFoundation framework one step
closer to a stable production-use candidate*

#Custom data-centric web applications, with time for the fun stuff!

*Rapid prototyping without static code-generation*

As developers we want to spend our time working on new features, exciting
algorithms or system integrations. In data-centric solutions however, we often
spend a lot of time building and maintaining fairly trivial structures of
data-oriented actions, from database schema maintenance, to GUI updates.

FlyFoundation is a framework that wants to reduce time spend on trivial
aspects of data-centric applications, and leave more time for the fun stuff.
Through Model-Driven principles and the use of the LSD specification language,
FlyFoundation helps you deliver full-featured data-system prototypes fast, and
with outstanding support for tweaking them into actual production systems later
on. Lets get started.

##Documentation

The following resources are available to help you get started with the framework,
and to better understand its design and structure:

###Getting started
How to install the framework and produce a basic application.

[Read the guide to getting started](docs/getting_started.md)

###LSD Documentation
Learn the syntax and the concepts of the LSD-language, that is used to rapidly
build data-centric applications with the LSD framework.

[Read the LSD docs](docs/lsd.md)

###Current features
A walk through of the features currently implemented in the framework, including
code samples with thorough explanations.

[Read the documentation on current features](docs/current_features.md)

###Architecture of the FlyFoundation Framework
A comprehensive description of the framework design, including technical details
which might tempt your curiosity and help you when contributing to the
development of the framework. An understanding of the architecture also gives
you a better understanding of the framework features as a whole.

[Read the documentation on the framework architecture](docs/architecture.md)

###Planned features
An explanation of the various features planned for the future development of
the framework, including fictive code samples and explanations.

[Read about the planed features](docs/planned_features.md)


##Help make FlyFoundation better
Though I hope you like what FlyFoundation is capable of at the moment, I would
love to see a way more full-featured version in the futures. For this we need
as many people working on the project as possible, contributing with their
good ideas for improving the framework, and writing code and tests to make it
happen. Get in touch or make a pull request.


##Get in touch
Please get in touch with me if you are interested in the project or have any good ideas for
the further development. I'm available at mv@signifly.com or Skype: michael_valentin.

Happy hacking! :-)
