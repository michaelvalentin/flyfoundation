#Custom data-centric web applications, with time for the fun stuff!

*Rapid prototyping without static code-generation*

As developers we are excited to work on new features, exciting algorithms or
system integrations. In data-centric solutions however, we often spend a lot
of time building and maintaining fairly trivial structures of data-oriented
actions, from database schema maintenance, to GUI updates.

FlyFoundation is a framework that wants to safe your time spend on trivial
aspects of data-centric applications, and leave more time for the fun stuff.
Through Model-Driven principles and the use of the LSD specification language,
FlyFoundation helps you deliver full-featured data-system prototypes fast, and
with outstanding support for tweaking them into actual production systems later
on. Lets get started.

##Help make FlyFoundation better
Though I hope you like what FlyFoundation is capable of at the moment, I would
love to see a way more full-featured version. For this we need

The ambition of the FlyFoundation framework, is to provide a simple and
intuitive way of creating data-centric web applications

It is currently under development, but is going to include a DSL for defining system aspects
such as data model, validations and routing centrally and with a minimum of hazzle. In the
long run the platform will provide dynamic generation of advanaced features common in 
data-intensive web-applications, such as translations, versioning, ACL, etc.

##Got any ideas?
Please get in touch with me if you are interested in the project or have any good ideas for
the further development. I'm available at mv@signifly.com or Skype: michael_valentin.

Happy hacking! :-)
